## ConfConf?

Today, [ConfConf 2016](http://confconf.github.io) was held in Seoul, South Korea. ConfConf is the small tack conference that speakers share their experiences about a conference they attended in last year. The concept is quite funny, isn't it? I was invited to share a story about Mozilla Festival 2015. 

Below are event list that the invited speakers attended in last year and shared today.

How awesome and various these are! While I was at there, I felt like being an attendee to all of those conferences. Especially, because only speakers could attend here, so there were only 9 people at the venue, it was really good to cencentrate presentations.


## Act Festival at my hometown

Act Festival stories made me want to attend later in particular. Act Festival is for media artists in the world. Even though Gwangju is my hometown in Korea, I've never hear about that festival as well as Dongmyung-dong in Gwangju the speaker praised highly. He said he was so sorry that many people didn't know about the festival due to lack of advertisement by the host even if the size of that was so huge and the quality of exhibition was really nice.

## interesting stories

Github Universe 2015 that was the first conference hosted by Github and had the best name tag, Ruby Kaigi 2015, two speakers made me who almost don't know Ruby get interested in the event with humors, and PyCon 2015 that looks like 'gathering' or family among who have incomparable respect to Python and **snake** also had interesting stories.

## thanks to

I'd like to express my appreciation to [@nacyo_t](http://twitter.com/nacyo_t) who is the host and invited me to this event. I could hear so diverse stories from great conferences that I wished to attend but I couldn't. For the next ConfConf, I'm not sure if there will be, anyway I really recommend you must attend, share your story, and hear others' stories!

and thanks to my girlfriend who took me Deungchon Kalgooksu, Lyn!
